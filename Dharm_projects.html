              <strong>Computer Science Principles - Image Manipulation Project:</strong>
              <h3>March 16, 2020 - April 3, 2020</h3>
              <p>This project taught me more than just how to manipulate images; it taught me how to utilize documentation for supplemental code. For this project, I used the Pillow fork of the Python Imaging Library and there were many methods which I did not know how to use properly, or to their full potential. For example, I used the documentation to figure out what the parameters were for the ellipse method, whether the coordinates were the center and outer or whether it created a box that the ellipse would be circumscribed in. One problem I ran into was that the top image was too tall to be able to fit in the frame of the polaroid, so I had to figure out how to crop it. This was another instance when I used the Pillow documentation to find the function that would work best and how to use it. Learning how to use documentation is an important skill because no one can remember how to code every method created, so referring to documentation is the best way to utilise the code to its full potential.</p>

              <strong>Computer Science Principles - MIT App Inventor Project:</strong>
              <h3>September 23, 2019 - October 9, 2019</h3>
              <p>This project allowed me to create an app on an android device using the MIT App Inventor Software. My partner and I started with a States and Captials Quiz tutorial and built off that. We added a timer, a score, changing colors to indicate which states the player answered correctly, and even a whole other quiz! What I learned most from working on this project was how far good teamwork can take you. My partner and I made sure we stayed on the same page at all times, through texting each other about any updates in the project and discussing our goals for the day as well as the next work day. We even created a routine for our workdays that allowed for the most efficient working process. Our workday would start by testing and fixing a problem faced the day before. After fixing the problem and throughly testing its competence, we would move on to a new feature we wanted to add or another problem that needed fixing. After trying out a few different ways, the workday would come to an end. So after saving and logging off our computers, we discussed what we would do at home and what our goals were for the next day. This routine and communication allowed us to add several more feature to our app than others were able to add to theirs. From this experience I learned the value of teamwork and will always be a team player. I will ensure that everyone is working not only collectively but collaboratively to maximize our effeciency.</p>

              <strong>Honors Principles of Engineering - Aerodynamic Design Project:</strong>
              <h3>January 8, 2019 - January 28, 2019</h3>
              <p>For this project, we designed and built a prototype rocket that was launched using a pressurized device, in order to determine what the optimal design and launching angle is for the maximum horizontal distance the projectile can travel. My main role in this project was to create ideas for the different designs. I came up with the basic design of  a rocket body with triangle stabilizers at the end and a flat body. Unlike most projects, I got it right the first time, and needed changes with my second design, since it went a much shorter distance than the first one. I saw that one of the problems was in the height of the cone at the top of the projectile. With a larger height, the cone would create less air resistance than a flater cone with less height. Another flaw in my second design was the weight. I added an extra layer of heavy-duty duct-tape and made the stabilizers thicker, causing the total weight of the projectile to increase. This heavier projectile requires more force to travel the same distance as a lighter projectile, making increasing the weight a bad idea.</p>

            <strong>Honors Principles of Engineering - Solar-Hydrogen Powered Car:</strong>
            <h3>November 1, 2018 - November 16, 2018</h3>
            <p>For this project, we designed and built a prototype car that ran on solar and hydrogen power in order to determine which power source is better. My role in this project was to make adjustments to the car in order to improve its functionality and create spaces for the different components on the car, like the breadboard and power sources. When we first tested the vehicle, it was stuttering forward rather than moving smoothly. After some inspection of the car, we realized that the axle was bent and so we replaced the axle and the problem was solved. </p>

            <p>Another challenge was attaching the breadboard securely without using abstract items like a rubber band. We solved this by placing four screws around the breadboard and screwing plates on top in order to keep it in place. Our team worked very well together and communicated about the major progress in a group chat. This made sure everyone was on the same page about the car. We also split up a lot of the work, but everyone contributed to every part of the project. So we had one person doing mostly documentation, two people designing and building the original structure, and I made modifications based on the mini-tests that I also conducted. In the end, I made sure that our project met all the requirements and retested everything.</p>
